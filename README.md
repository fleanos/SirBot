# SirBot

The bot is made with use of python and using the discord api and various random api's for various commands that I thought would be funny/somewhat useful to have within our friend group's server

Fuctions:

/hello - bot responds to the user with a greeting

/mango - gives a random picture of mango, the only dog ill ever love

/kanye - gives a kanye quote, uses api for kanye quotes

/bored - gives user an activity to do, uses a api that provides random activites

/wooper - gives random picture of wooper, with pictures sourced from a pokemon api
